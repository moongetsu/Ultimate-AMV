 * REPLACES the retired per-tile IntersectionObserver mount decision so the
 * live-<video> union can never exceed the EFFECTIVE cap (clamped to
 * MAX_GRID_VIDEO_PLAYERS_CEILING by the caller). Computed from scroll GEOMETRY
 * only — never from Virtuoso's inflated overscan range and never from
 * offsetMetrics.activeCount (a feedback loop).
 *
 *  1. Eligible band = the visible rows EXTENDED by `marginRows` on each side (the
 *     250px pre-play pre-warm preserved as rows).
 *  2. The EFFECTIVE cap is floored at the count of tiles ACTUALLY visible
 *     (visibleTileCount = visible-row count × cols, clamped to the real clip
 *     count) so a tall/dense viewport (e.g. 16–24 visible tiles at 4 cols)
 *     never leaves a still-visible tile dark when the knob cap (prod 12) is
 *     below the visible band. The incoming `cap` (the knob value, already
 *     ceiling-clamped by the caller) can only RAISE the cap above that floor to
 *     add pre-warm headroom; MAX_GRID_VIDEO_PLAYERS_CEILING still bounds the top.
 *  3. Grant in TWO phases: (a) every VISIBLE tile unconditionally — the floor
 *     guarantees they fit — then (b) fill the remaining budget with PRE-WARM
 *     tiles, walking OUTWARD from the viewport-center row (nearest first) until
 *     the effective cap is reached. Granting visible tiles in their own phase
 *     (not via the center walk) is what prevents a nearer-to-center pre-warm tile
 *     from stealing the last budget slot from a farther-but-still-VISIBLE tile on
 *     an asymmetric band (the cap-below-visible dead-zone).
 *
 * Extracted as a pure function (no React) so the hard cap can be unit-tested
 * deterministically across a scripted fast-fling (jsdom has no real Virtuoso
 * geometry). The `geometryMountVideoIds` memo calls this verbatim.
