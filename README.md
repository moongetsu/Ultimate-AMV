# Ultimate AMV

A Windows desktop app for building anime music video edits. It handles the full workflow in one place : browsing and downloading source footage, separating audio, extracting clips, and exporting the final cut.

## Features

- **Built-in browser** with automatic episode and series detection on anime streaming sites
- **Audio separation** : split any track into vocals and instrumentals using ML models, with CPU and NVIDIA GPU (CUDA) support
- **Clip extraction** : frame-accurate trimming and export via ffmpeg, with GPU-accelerated decoding where available
- **Download manager** : grab footage directly from streaming sites via a bundled yt-dlp integration
- **Self-contained setup** : a first-run wizard installs all ML dependencies (PyTorch, audio-separator, ONNX Runtime) into a bundled Python environment, no manual setup required
- **Custom themes** : preset colour schemes plus full hex colour customisation

---

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or later, 64-bit
- Around 4 GB of free disk space for the app and base dependencies
- GPU mode requires an NVIDIA GPU with CUDA 12.x drivers installed

---

## Installation

Download the latest installer from the [Releases](../../releases) page and run it. No admin rights required : it installs per-user by default.

On first launch, open **Settings** and run the setup wizard to install the audio and clip processing backends. The wizard handles everything automatically.

---

## Development

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 20+, Rust (stable), the [Tauri v2 prerequisites](https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/)

**Clone and install:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ElishaPervez/Ultimate-AMV.git
cd Ultimate-AMV
npm install
```

**Bundled runtime dependencies** (required before running or building):

Place a [Windows embeddable Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) distribution in `python/`, then run:

```powershell
./bundle-deps.ps1
```

Also place `yt-dlp.exe`, `ffmpeg.exe`, and `ffprobe.exe` in `tools/`.

**Run in dev mode:**

```bash
npm run desktop
```

**Build installer:**

```bash
npm run tauri build
```

The NSIS installer will be output to `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/nsis/`.

---

## Release builds

Releases are built automatically by GitHub Actions when a version tag is pushed. The workflow downloads all runtime dependencies (Python, ffmpeg, yt-dlp), builds the Tauri app, and attaches the installer to the GitHub Release.

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```
